## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔐 1. Generate a GitHub Token

Create a GitHub [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with the following scopes:

- `read:user`
- `user:follow`

### 🛠️ 2. Clone the Repo

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/github-unfollow-bot.git
    cd github-unfollow-bot

### 📁 3. Environment Setup

To configure the bot, create a `.env` file in the root of the project using the format below:

    # .env

    # Your GitHub username
    GITHUB_USERNAME=your_github_username

    # Your GitHub personal access token
    GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here

    # Optional: usernames to always keep following (comma-separated)
    IGNORE_LIST=torvalds,octocat,myfriend123

> 📌 You can use the provided `.env.example` file as a template:

    cp .env.example .env

### ⚠️ .env Security Reminder

Your `.env` file contains sensitive information. **Do not commit it** to version control.

Ensure this line is in your `.gitignore`:

    .env

### ▶️ 4. Run the Bot

    python unfollow_bot.py

Optional flags:

    --dry-run           # Show who would be unfollowed without taking action
    --min-followers 10  # Unfollow users with fewer than 10 followers
    --inactive-days 180 # Unfollow users inactive for more than 180 days
